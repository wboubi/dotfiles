# dotfiles

My dotfile repo is [here](https://bitbucket.org/wboubi/dotfiles)

*"Don't put all your eggs in one basket."*

## TL; DR
Just launch 

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://bitbucket.org/wboubi/dotfiles/raw/master/bin/dotfiles)" && zsh
```
**Warning you're not me, this script can be _very messy_ on your computer !**
